Title : Audience_ratings Prediction Model

Description:
This implementation creates a machine learning model to predict movie audience ratings using data from Rotten Tomatoes. The code employs a Random Forest Regressor with comprehensive data analysis, model validation, and visualization techniques.
Key Features:

Comprehensive Data Processing:


Handles missing values and data cleaning
Utilizes multiple features: tomatometer rating, runtime, and critic count
Implements proper train-test split (80-20)


Advanced Model Implementation:


Uses Random Forest Regression with hyperparameter tuning
Includes baseline model comparison
Implements cross-validation for robust evaluation


Thorough Performance Analysis:


Multiple accuracy metrics (RMSE, RÂ², MAE)
Accuracy scores at different thresholds (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 rating points)
Overall prediction accuracy and error analysis


Visual Analysis:


Feature importance visualization
Actual vs predicted comparisons
Error distribution analysis
Correlation heatmaps
Feature-wise error analysis

The model provides a robust framework for predicting audience ratings and understanding the relationships between critic and audience preferences in movie ratings, with a focus on accuracy and interpretability through comprehensive visualization and statistical analysis.
Result: The implementation successfully predicts audience ratings with detailed performance metrics and visual insights, demonstrating the relationship between critic ratings and audience preferences.
